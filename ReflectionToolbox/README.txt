MP!-release 1.1

To run simply run MP1-Improved.py, the code doesn't look a whole lot different, though now the numbers are more accurate, as it removes percieved differences in words due to extra capitalization or puncuation.  For example, previously "Dastardly", "dastardly", "Dastardly," and "dastardly," were all different, but now they are all represented as "dastardly".  It will output four graphs, one for each album chosen.
